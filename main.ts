// Main idea:
// We have 3 players, 1 bot or a real person who conducts the game.
// The game is conducted by providing a question and a word.
// To guess a letter from a word,
// each player rotates the wheel.
// On each rotation, a player gets a score that lets to guess a letter,
// otherwise, a player gets "bankrupt" or "skip" that turns a move to the next
// player.
// The winner alone gets to the final part of the game to guess another word
// but has a right to guess 3 letters straightaway.
// Then, before 1 minute passed, a player has to guess a word,
// otherwise, it's a loss.
